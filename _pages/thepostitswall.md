During my first year of PhD, I started in my office what my officemates and I now call "The Post-Its Wall". 
It started with sticking my To-Do list on the wall. Today, I add a new post-it almost daily. 
On each one of them, there is either a definition, a useful trick, a theorem, a vague idea/intuition of some concept, some relevant computations...

Some may be outdated and contain mistakes.

Here is a picture of me in front of the post-its wall:

And now the wall during golden hour:

Finally, here is the post-its wall with my rainbowlike post-its:

The post-its wall does not have a color code, however most greenish post-its are about manifolds.
